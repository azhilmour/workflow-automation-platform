# Phase 1 Implementation Summary

## Overview
Phase 1 of the workflow execution system has been successfully implemented. This phase establishes the core infrastructure needed for workflow execution.

## Completed Components

### 1. Database Layer

#### WorkflowExecutionEntity (`packages/db/src/entities/WorkflowExecutionEntity.ts`)
- New database entity to track workflow executions
- Fields:
  - `id`: UUID primary key
  - `workflowId`: Reference to the workflow
  - `userId`: User who triggered the execution
  - `status`: RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED, or PENDING
  - `triggerData`: Initial webhook payload
  - `nodeExecutions`: Array of node execution results
  - `error`: Error message if failed
  - `startedAt`: Execution start time
  - `completedAt`: Execution completion time

#### Database Configuration Updated
- Added all entities to TypeORM DataSource configuration
- Entities now include: User, WorkflowEntity, CredentialsEntity, WebhookEntity, WorkflowExecutionEntity

### 2. Type Definitions

#### Execution Types (`apps/executor/src/types/execution.types.ts`)
- `IExecutionContext`: Runtime context for workflow execution
- `INodeExecutionResult`: Result of node execution
- `INodeExecutor`: Interface for node executors
- `NodeType`: Enum of supported node types

### 3. Core Services

#### ExecutionService (`apps/executor/src/services/ExecutionService.ts`)
Database operations for workflow executions:
- `createExecution()`: Create new execution record
- `getExecution()`: Get execution by ID
- `getExecutionsByWorkflow()`: List executions for a workflow
- `addNodeExecution()`: Record individual node execution result
- `completeExecution()`: Mark execution as completed or failed
- `updateStatus()`: Update execution status

#### WorkflowService (`apps/executor/src/services/WorkflowService.ts`)
Workflow and webhook operations:
- `getWorkflowById()`: Load workflow from database
- `getWebhookById()`: Get webhook by ID and method
- `incrementTriggerCount()`: Track workflow triggers
- `isWorkflowActive()`: Check if workflow is active

#### CredentialsService (`apps/executor/src/services/CredentialsService.ts`)
Credentials management:
- `getCredentials()`: Get and decrypt credentials by ID
- `getCredentialsByType()`: Get credentials by type (e.g., 'resend')
- `decrypt()`: Decrypt credential data (basic implementation)
- `decryptAES()`: AES encryption support (for future use)

### 4. Execution Engine

#### ExecutionContext (`apps/executor/src/engine/ExecutionContext.ts`)
- Manages runtime execution state
- Stores trigger data and node outputs
- Tracks execution status

#### ExecutionEngine (`apps/executor/src/engine/ExecutionEngine.ts`)
Core orchestration logic:
- `executeWorkflow()`: Main entry point for workflow execution
- `startExecution()`: Initiates the execution flow
- `executeNode()`: Executes a single node (placeholder for now)
- `executeNextNodes()`: Finds and executes connected nodes
- Supports parallel node execution
- Error handling and execution tracking

### 5. API Endpoints

Updated webhook handler (`apps/executor/src/index.ts`):
- **POST /webhook/handler/:id**: Trigger workflow execution
  - Accepts webhook ID in URL
  - Parses request body as trigger data
  - Returns execution ID immediately
  - Executes workflow asynchronously

- **GET /executions/:id**: Get execution details
  - Returns full execution record with node executions
  
- **GET /executions/workflow/:id**: List executions for a workflow
  - Returns last 50 executions for the workflow

- **GET /health**: Health check endpoint

## Architecture Highlights

### Async Execution
- Webhook handler returns immediately after starting execution
- Execution runs in background (fire and forget)
- Prevents webhook timeout issues

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Execution status tracking (RUNNING, COMPLETED, FAILED)
- Error messages stored in execution record
- Console logging for debugging

### Database Integration
- Uses TypeORM repositories for all database operations
- Proper entity relationships
- JSONB columns for flexible data storage

### Extensibility
- Node executor interface ready for Phase 2
- Service layer separates concerns
- Easy to add new node types

```

## Next Steps (Phase 2)

Phase 2 will implement the basic node executors:
1. TriggerNodeExecutor - Extract and validate webhook context
2. HttpRequestNodeExecutor - Make HTTP requests
3. Expression resolver utility - For dynamic parameter resolution

## Testing the Implementation

To test Phase 1:

1. Start the executor service:
```bash
cd apps/executor
bun run dev
```

2. Trigger a webhook (requires a workflow with webhook setup):
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/webhook/handler/YOUR_WEBHOOK_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"key": "value"}'
```

3. Check execution details:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/executions/EXECUTION_ID
```

4. List workflow executions:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/executions/workflow/WORKFLOW_ID
```

## Notes

- The database will auto-create tables in development mode (synchronize: true)
- Node execution is currently a placeholder - actual node logic comes in Phase 2
- Credentials are stored as plain JSON for now - encryption should be added before production
- All services use TypeORM repositories for database access
